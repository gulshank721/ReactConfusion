# Restaurant Website(Ongoing)

## Ristorante Con Fusion
Ristorante Con Fusion is a Single-Page ReactJS Web Application (SPA) for an Indian-based Restaurant called Confusion that aims to
show restaurant's available dishes and make users able to choose favorite dishes and comment them. The application is built on the React-Redux Architecture and using RESTful web services architecture.
I have developed this Website(SPA) using ReactJs , Redux Architecture and REST API Client Server Communication.

React has been used as frontend for Component based User Interface.\
NodeJs,ExpressJs and MongoDB has been used for server side development and for database storage.

This Website will facilitates User login facilities, viewing food item list,
about resturant and working chefs and also give comments about a dish.
